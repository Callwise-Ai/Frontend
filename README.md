## Overview

CallWise is an innovative platform revolutionizing communication with **Echo**, a custom AI call bot powered by **SambaNova’s API**. This project empowers users to create context-aware, real-time AI call bots and APIs trained on their unique data, seamlessly integrated into diverse applications. 

The **frontend**, built using **Next.js**, features:

- A **landing page** where users set up their API key through **CallWise AI Studio**.
- Options to choose a SambaNova model and upload a context file containing business or organizational details.
- A **dashboard** listing all the generated API keys as projects.

---

## Features

- **AI Call Bot Toolkit**: Deploy intelligent, context-aware call bots without internet dependency.
- **CallWise AI Studio**: Create APIs trained on custom datasets and integrate them into personal projects.
- **Project Dashboard**: View and manage all API keys and projects.

---

## Inspiration

The idea for CallWise stems from the need for smarter, context-aware communication solutions. By integrating advanced AI, CallWise redefines traditional IVR systems with real-time responses and customizable solutions.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** for the frontend.
- **Python** for backend logic.
- **SambaNova API** for leveraging powerful language model capabilities.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI design.
- **React** for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Flask** for backend API handling.
- **Twilio** for phone call integration.
- **Deepgram** for real-time transcription.
